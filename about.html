            <p>Hi! We are The Vessels. A group of passionate musicians who likes to jam different types of genre of music.
                We have covered varous genre, from Coldplay, Smashing Pumpkins, Cranberries, and even 90's like Roxette and The Wonders.
                We also did covered Filipino songs such as 214 from Rivermaya, which later on we did a rendition of a Lo-Fi version. You 
                can find it on our facebook page "The Vessels" Please check it out! Am I real? Do the words I speak before you make you feel That the love I lay for you will see no ending?
                Well, if you look into my eyes, then you should know That there is nothing here to doubt, nothing to fear
                And you can lay your questions down, 'cause if you'll hold me We can fade into the night, and you'll know
                The world could die, and everything may lie Still, you shan't cry
                'Cause time may pass, but longer than it'll last I'll be by your side
                Take my hand And gently close your eyes so you could understand
                That there's no greater love tonight than what I've for you Well, if you feel the same way for me, then let go
                We can journey to a garden no one knows Life is short, my darling, tell me that you love me
                So we can fade into the night, and you'll know The world could die, and everything may lie
                Still, you shan't cry'Cause time may pass, but longer than it'll last
                I'll be by your side, forever by your side I want you to know
                The world could lie, and everything may die Still, you shan't cry
                'Cause time may pass, and everything won't last I'll be by your side, forever by your side
